Here you can find the JSON Schema for validating Open\+API definitions of versions 3.\+0.\+X.

As a reminder, the JSON Schema is not the source of truth for the Specification. In cases of conflicts between the Specification itself and the JSON Schema, the Specification wins. Also, some Specification constraints cannot be represented with the JSON Schema so it\textquotesingle{}s highly recommended to employ other methods to ensure compliance.

The iteration version of the JSON Schema can be found in the {\ttfamily id} field. For example, the value of {\ttfamily id\+: \href{https://spec.openapis.org/oas/3.0/schema/2019-04-02}{\texttt{ https\+://spec.\+openapis.\+org/oas/3.\+0/schema/2019-\/04-\/02}}} means this iteration was created on April 2nd, 2019.

To submit improvements to the schema, modify the schema.\+yaml file only.

The TSC will then\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Run tests on the updated schema
\item Update the iteration version
\item Convert the schema.\+yaml to schema.\+json
\item Publish the new version 
\end{DoxyItemize}
